<h1>Hi, I'm Erik Smyth! 
<h1>Summary</h1>I'm an entry-level cloud professional transitioning from a 20+ year career in residential painting and construction project coordination into the digital side of healthcare.
  I specialize in Microsoft Azure, building secure and scalable environments that align with HIPAA compliance, healthcare IoT integrations, and real-time patient monitoring solutions. ⚫ My T-shaped expertse spans:
🔹 Azure Administrator – Virtual networks, IAM, VM provisioning, storage
🔹 Azure Security – Conditional access, Defender, JIT access, DLP
🔹 Healthcare IoT – IoT Hub, FHIR APIs, Stream Analytics, secure device telemetry ⚫
My GitHub showcases real-world cloud labs simulating clinic-level infrastructure and IoT projects. ⚫ I’m currently targeting cloud admin and healthcare cloud roles in Georgia and remote-friendly positions.
Let’s connect if you're building HIPAA-compliant cloud environments, integrating IoT in healthcare, or need a motivated technologist who understands both physical and digital infrastructure.
