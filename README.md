<h1>Hi, I'm Erik Smyth! 
<h1>Summary</h1>I‚Äôm an entry-level IT professional with CompTIA A+, Network+, Project+, and ITIL v4 certifications, and hands-on experience with Active Directory and Windows Server 2019. I have built home lab environments to practice user/group management, Group Policy, and foundational network administration.

Currently, I am pursuing the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification to expand my skills in cloud administration and security. My goal is to transition into IT support, help desk, or NOC roles while continuing to grow in Azure cloud technologies.

On this GitHub, you‚Äôll find verified labs, project walkthroughs, and code snippets demonstrating my technical skills and hands-on experience. All certifications, labs, and projects are linked and fully verifiable to support my professional profile.
